# National-Weather-Serivce Data Resources
This GitHub repository demonstrates the process of using Python to convert multiple weather forecast text files into an interpretable dataset. This repo is designed for the sole purpose of describing and displaying the before and after transformation of files using my developed Python script. Unfortunately, due to proprietary and intellectual property restrictions, I am unable to provide any of my developed code.

Please refer to the NWS_Weather_Project_Description.docx for a complete explaination of this project repo as well as illustrated examples.

Happy Coding!
